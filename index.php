    <p class="para1">Hello fellow adventure seekers!My name is Ilona.
        Since I was a kid I remember myself dreaming  of wild adventures across the globe. Every mention of another country or  
        a screenshot from a film would spark my imagination. I guess it’s because I was born in a small province in the former Soviet 
        Union and there wasn’t much going on around me.</p><br>

    <p class="para2">Without a doubt travel bug runs deep in my veins. Some people are going to psychologist when they need to break free from their  
        thoughts, issues, dilemmas and I? I just buy ticket to a flight. 
        My ultimate dream would be ,lead extraordinary carefree expat lifestyle , where I could travel and work simultaneously .Won’t you?
        This blog is  both my memoirs from past travels but also  thoughts and experiences  from current ones.</p>
